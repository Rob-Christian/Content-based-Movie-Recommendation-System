# Content-based Movie Recommendation System
A movie recommendation system was developed using content-based approach. The dataset used is obtained from [IMDB Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitshankhdhar/imdb-dataset-of-top-1000-movies-and-tv-shows?select=imdb_top_1000.csv). 

The system is also deployed through Streamlit Cloud.
